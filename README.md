![KOML Banner](logo.png)

**K.O.M.L. (KOML)** is the memecoin for hip-hop heads and wordplay enthusiasts. It's a community-driven token built on the Solana chain that celebrates lyrical prowess and rewards holding power.

## Why K.O.M.L.?

- **Flow Like Fire:** We're all about the art of rap, the power of the verse, and the fire that ignites a good diss track.
- **Memeing with Meaning:** We take our memes seriously. Expect clever wordplay, hilarious hip-hop references, and community-driven content creation.
- **Hodl for the Gold:** Similar to a dope mixtape getting better with age, K.O.M.L. utilizes a deflationary system where tokens are burned with each transaction, making them rarer and more valuable over time.
- **The Cypher of Holders:** We believe the power of the community is the ultimate mic drop. K.O.M.L. is owned and operated by its holders, with a focus on decentralization and community governance.
